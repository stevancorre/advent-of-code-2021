# Advent Of Code ~ 2021

## What is Advent of Code ?

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

This is my first time doing that, and to make it more interesting, i'm going to use a different language for each puzzle.

## Roadmap

To make something original, I'll use on different programming language per day. To know what language I should use for the `nth` day, I thinked of using `advent of code by stevan corre` as a "plan", since it contains `25` letters, for the `nth` day, I take the `nth` letter of this sentence, find a programming language which starts with this letter, and use it !
